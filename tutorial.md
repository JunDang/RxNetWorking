In the tutorial, I will implement the network requests in RxSwift, fetch the picture from the Flickr API, parsing the JSON data, and bind the picture to the UI. The topics will be covered include:
1. Networking implemented with RxSwift
2. JSON data parsing with Swift 4 Codable.
3. Implement MVVM design pattern
4. Unit test with RxTest
